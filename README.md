## ThDriver

### Status

ThDriver is not in active development. The async Python software libraries evolved and there are far more maintained libraries to do async socket I/O with Python (even on the standard library). If you want to use a well maintained library, please use `asyncio` from the standard library that is more optimized and easy to code to. But feel free to use my library if you have a specific requirement.

### Introduction

ThDriver is a socket abstraction library and a main loop for
network-driven applications inspired off Twisted.
I wrote it when I was working on a hobby MUD server project for learning
purposes and thought it could be useful for other types of applications as well.

### Installation

To install the package, use the standard procedure for installing
Python packages:
```
$python setup.py install
```

### Getting started

An example is provided in the "examples" directory.
However, if you want to explore more deeply into the code, in the mean time, the only way
to do this is to look at the API docs of the package.
Documentation is sparce, but it is constantly being worked on to reflect the state
of the project.

### How to help

All the help is very appreciated. Code changes, documentation bug reports
and general bug fixes can be done using a pull request or issue in
GitHub.
