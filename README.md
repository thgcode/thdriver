## ThDriver

### Introduction
ThDriver is a socket abstraction library and a main loop for
network-driven applications inspired off Twisted.
I wrote it when I was working on a hobby MUD server project for learning
purposes and thought it could be useful for other types of applications as well.

### Installation
To install the package, use the standard procedure for installing
Python packages:
```
$python setup.py install
```

### Getting started
An example is provided in the "examples" directory.
However, if you want to explore more deeply into the code, in the mean time, the only way
to do this is to look at the API docs of the package.
Documentation is sparce, but it is constantly being worked on to reflect the state
of the project.

### How to help
All the help is very appreciated. Code changes, documentation bug reports
and general bug fixes can be done using a pull request or issue in
GitHub.
