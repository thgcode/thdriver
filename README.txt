ThDriver

Introduction
ThDriver is a socket abstraction library and a main loop for
network-driven applications inspired off Twisted.
I wrote it when I was working on a hobby MUD server project for learning
purposes and thought it could be useful for other types of applications as well.

Getting started
In the mean time, the only way to get started is looking at the source
code of the package, but documentation is being built, so check often.

How to help
All the help is very appreciated. Code changes, documentation bug reports
and general bug fixes can be done using a pull request or issue in
github.
